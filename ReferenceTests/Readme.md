# Reference tests for the Test Adapter for Catch2

For the development of the **Test Adapter for Catch2** some Catch2 tests were created. Some of these tests are actually used in the unit tests for the different components of the **Test Adapter for Catch2**. Others are just used the manually check how the test adapter handles them. So expect many of the tests to be failing tests. The different test-projects are collected in the `ReferenceTests.sln` solution.

**Warning: the written tests do not necessarily follow best practices.**
